# My . Files

I decided to put my .files on here to easily move them between machines.

''sudo apt install zsh mosh tmux curl -y''

chsh -s $(which zsh)

sh -c “$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)”

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | zsh
